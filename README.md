# ServerClientCalculator
A calculator programme with a built-in GUI, designed through two programmes acting as a Server and a Client.

A simple calculator processing unit designed in Python, along with a built-in GUI and logger. This project includes a client programme which can subscribe to a server programme. All user inputs are followed by appropriate functions, whether valid or not. For further improvement, additional clients could be added to the same server through threading.
